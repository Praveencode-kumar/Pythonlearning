#Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure functions. In fact,
#some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that
#programs that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs
#that use modifiers. But modifiers are convenient at times, and functional programs tend to
#be less efficient.
#In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is reasonable and resort
#to modifiers only if there is a compelling advantage. This approach might be called a
#functional programming style
